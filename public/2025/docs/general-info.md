# Welcome to ETHTokyo!
ETHTokyo'25 is a 4-day Ethereum conference and hackathon, dedicated to advance the development and adoption of Ethereum. If you are a developer, researcher, creative, professional, student, or anyone driven by a shared sense of cypherpunk ethos and optimism for the future, this event is for you. 

**2025 Theme: Emancipatory Tech for Future of Humanity**

Emancipation begins in the mind; let us radically reimagine how we can harness technology to empower people, preserve culture, and build a sustainable future in ways not possible today. The goal is to innovate not for its own sake, but to envision new ways and better approaches to do things through reshaping and redefining the constraints of our own constructed reality.
